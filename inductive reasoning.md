Inductive reasoning is a method where past observations or experiences are used to reach a broader, general conclusion. So induction relies on past experiences and observations. 

In contrast to [[deductive reasoning]] (which is a top-down logic), which starts with a general statement and examines the possibilities to reach a specific conclusion, inductive reasoning (a bottom-up logic) begins with specific examples and tries to form a general rule. 

If you are doing inductive reasoning, you are starting with specific observations and measures, detecting patterns and regularities, formulating some tentative hypotheses to explore, and finally you develop some general conclusions or theories.

# Origin of inductive reasoning
[[Francis Bacon]] is considered the father of inductive reasoning, as he is considered the father of [[empiricism]]. Inductive reasoning uses our senses and experiences to make judgments.

Induction process isn't as solid as [[deductive reasoning]]. Rather than using broad generalizations, induction takes single experiences or facts as premises. This premise could be something you’ve personally experienced or witnessed or an experience told to you by a friend, parent, TV personality, etc. 

The premises provide _some_ evidence to build a conclusion. This conclusion might not be true if you’re just pulling from a one-time occurrence or a handful of experiences. Conclusions derived from induction don’t make them the truth. They show the probability of an event occurring. 

# Example use
## Example 1
After multiple days of leaving for work at different times, you've concluded that **If I leave for work at < time > , I can avoid traffic.** What reasoning is this?

It’s an inductive, conditional rule (a personal [[heuristic]]).
- **Why it’s inductive:** You’ve observed that on the days you leave at a certain hour, there's less traffic. From those repeated observations you infer a general “rule”: _If I leave at < time >, I’ll avoid traffic._ 
- **What kind of statement it is:** An **if‑then** (conditional) claim that also expresses a causal link—your departure time causes the outcome of lighter traffic.
So, in terms of reasoning taxonomy you’re using inductive reasoning to form a causal/conditional heuristic.
## Example 2
**If Sun tends to rise in the east and you want to know where the sun will rise tomorrow**, what kind of reasoning will you use?

You’ll use **inductive reasoning**.
- **What you have:** Repeated observations that *the Sun rises in the east* day after day.  
- **What you infer:** Because this pattern has held true in the past, it will hold true tomorrow as well -> “The Sun will rise in the east tomorrow.”

Induction moves from specific instances (many days of sunrise) to a general expectation about a future instance.  

*(If you started with the scientific premise “the Earth rotates west‑to‑east” and then derived that the Sun appears to rise in the east, that would be deductive reasoning. But in everyday life we usually rely on the observed regularity, which is inductive.)*

# Onset of Inductive reasoning in humans
Jean Piaget theorized that children develop inductive reasoning around age 7. e.g. Child touches a hot stove and burn their hand. So, they're careful around hot stoves in the future. 
# Quiz Yourself
This is the most important part. When you step out, look at your different reasonings and see if you're coming to the conclusion based off of your experiences (inductive), or based on data (deductive).
