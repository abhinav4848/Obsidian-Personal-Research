Inductive reasoning is a method where specific observations or experiences are used to reach a broader, general conclusion. 

In contrast to [[deductive reasoning]], which starts with a general statement and examines the possibilities to reach a specific conclusion, inductive reasoning begins with specific examples and tries to form a general rule.

Inductive reasoning uses individual observations and experiences to formulate more general conclusions. So it relies on past experiences and observations.
