Inductive reasoning is a method where specific observations or experiences are used to reach a broader, general conclusion. 

In contrast to [[deductive reasoning]], which starts with a general statement and examines the possibilities to reach a specific conclusion, inductive reasoning begins with specific examples and tries to form a general rule.

Inductive reasoning uses individual observations and experiences to formulate more general conclusions. So it relies on past experiences and observations. 

# Origin of inductive reasoning
[[Francis Bacon]] is considered the father of inductive reasoning, as he is considered the father of [[empiricism]]. Inductive reasoning uses our senses and experiences to make judgments.

Induction process isn't as solid as [[deductive reasoning]]. Rather than using broad generalizations, induction takes single experiences or facts as premises. This premise could be something you’ve personally experienced or witnessed or an experience told to you by a friend, parent, TV personality, etc. 

The premises provide _some_ evidence to build a conclusion. You might think, "But the conclusion might not be true if you’re just pulling from a one-time occurrence or a handful of experiences.", and you're correct. Conclusions derived from induction don’t make them the truth. They show the probability of an event occurring.
