Inductive reasoning is a method where past observations or experiences are used to reach a broader, general conclusion. So induction relies on past experiences and observations. 

In contrast to [[deductive reasoning]], which starts with a general statement and examines the possibilities to reach a specific conclusion, inductive reasoning begins with specific examples and tries to form a general rule.

# Origin of inductive reasoning
[[Francis Bacon]] is considered the father of inductive reasoning, as he is considered the father of [[empiricism]]. Inductive reasoning uses our senses and experiences to make judgments.

Induction process isn't as solid as [[deductive reasoning]]. Rather than using broad generalizations, induction takes single experiences or facts as premises. This premise could be something you’ve personally experienced or witnessed or an experience told to you by a friend, parent, TV personality, etc. 

The premises provide _some_ evidence to build a conclusion. This conclusion might not be true if you’re just pulling from a one-time occurrence or a handful of experiences. Conclusions derived from induction don’t make them the truth. They show the probability of an event occurring. 

# Example use
If I leave for work at < time > , I can avoid traffic.

# Onset of Inductive reasoning
Jean Piaget theorized that children develop inductive reasoning around age 7. e.g. Child touches a hot stove and burn their hand. So, they're careful around hot stoves in the future. 
# Quiz Yourself
This is the most important part. When you step out, look at your different reasonings and see if you're coming to the conclusion based off of your experiences (inductive), or based on data (deductive).
