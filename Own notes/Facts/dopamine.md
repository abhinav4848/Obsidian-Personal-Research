Dopamine is a neurotransmitter in the brain associated with pleasure, reward, motivation, and motor control.

In psychology, dopamine is linked to feelings of gratification and is implicated in mood disorders, [[Addiction]], and certain behaviors when its levels are imbalanced.

Dopamine acts as the **brain’s reward chemical** that is released during pleasurable experiences, working with the brain’s reward system. 

In classical studies of rats, 
1. a surge of dopamine prompts the animal to press a lever to get a pellet of food repeatedly.
2. Dopamine is also released during the **anticipation of reward**. This creates [[secondary motivational factors|powerful reinforcement cycles]] that encourage us to repeat behaviors that lead to a pleasant experience, making dopamine central to the brain’s reward system.

# How Dopamine is produced & why using social media ruins drive
Dopamine is produced during the natural [[sleep]] cycle. If the first thing in the morning is for you to look at social media, it will squeeze out all the dopamine and the rest of the day will be deprived of excitement for a [[Reward system of the brain|reward]].
