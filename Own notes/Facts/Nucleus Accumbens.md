# Nucleus Accumbens
It’s often referred to as a key player in the **brain’s reward system**. 
It’s kind of like the **“fuel pump” of motivation**—it doesn’t decide _what_ you want, but it gives you the energy to go after it.

## Significance
As a whole, the Nucleus Accumbens has a significant role in the cognitive processing of motivation, aversion, reward (i.e., incentive salience, pleasure, and positive reinforcement), and reinforcement learning (e.g., Pavlovian-instrumental transfer); hence, it has a significant role in [[addiction]].

## Example of its use in daily life
When you:
- Check your phone and get a like
- Finish a task and feel accomplished
- Eat your favorite dessert 
	…that _rush of satisfaction_ is due to the nucleus accumbens doing its thing.
## Anatomy
Nucleus Accumbens is a region in the basal forebrain rostral (near to the face) to the preoptic area of the hypothalamus. It, along with the olfactory tubercle collectively for the corpus striatum (which is the main component of basal ganglia). 

The dopaminergic neurons of the mesolimbic pathway project onto the GABAergic medium spiny neurons of the nucleus accumbens and olfactory tubercle.
