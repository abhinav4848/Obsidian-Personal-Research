Philosophy is a field that relies on logic and speculation, to understand the nature of reality, experience, and values. 

- Psychology borrowed theories of the nature of the mind / behavior
- [[Rene Descartes]] – distinction between mind and body / relation between the two 
- Locke – all human knowledge arises from experience of the world / reflection about it; what we know about the world is based on how it is represented in the mind
