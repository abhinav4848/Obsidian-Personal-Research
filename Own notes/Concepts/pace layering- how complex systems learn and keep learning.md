A civilization as a whole has different parts to it which move at different speeds. And although all parts move independently, they all influence one another.

*The order of a healthy civilization*

The fast layers **innovate**; the slow layers **stabilize**. The whole combines learning with continuity.

| Fast Layer | Slow Layer |
| --- | --- |
| Learns | Remembers |
| Proposes | Disposes |
| Absorbs shocks | Integrates shock |
| Discontinuous | Continuous |
| Innovation/Revolution | Constraint/Constancy |
| Gets all the attention | Has all the power |

## Real World Example

Education is intellectual infrastructure.¬†So is science.¬†They have very high yield, but delayed payback.¬†Hasty societies that can't span those delays will lose out over time to societies that can.¬†On the other hand, cultures too hidebound to allow education to advance at infrastructural pace also lose out.
