# Skinner box
research from the 60's by B. F. Skinner. 
aka **operant conditioning chamber**. 

It’s a controlled environment used to study behavior reinforcement (learning through consequences) — specifically how rewards and punishments shape behavior. 

> [!NOTE] Skinner box + Dark Pattern
> Any design pattern that hacks the reward pathwyas of your brain to get you to do something you wouldn't, without that design.

# Pigeons in a box experiment
There were three things that could happen
### When button was pressed, pigeon got food
So they pressed when they needed food, got a dopamine spike and that was it.
### Nothing happened when button was pressed 
so clearly pigeons did not press the button. 
### Variable ratio schedule
Sometimes food came out, other times it didn't. 

It was uncertain on which press will the food come out. This time the pigeon pressed the button over and over and over. The food accumulating and going uneaten. The uncertainty whether the button press will give food was hacking the reward circuit of the brain & was giving them dopamine just from pressing the button. 

[[Schedules of Reinforcement]] can make behaviors very persistent.
