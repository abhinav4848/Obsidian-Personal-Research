# Skinner box
research from the 60's by B. F. Skinner.
aka **operant conditioning chamber**. 

It’s a controlled environment used to study behavior reinforcement (learning through consequences) — specifically how rewards and punishments shape behavior.

> [!NOTE] Skinner box + Dark Pattern
> Any design pattern that hacks the reward pathwyas of your brain to get you to do something you wouldn't, without that design. 

***Your phone is a skinner box.***
# Pigeons in a box experiment
There were three things that could happen
### When button was pressed, pigeon got food
So they pressed when they needed food, got a dopamine spike and that was it.
### Nothing happened when button was pressed 
so clearly pigeons did not press the button. 
### Variable ratio schedule
Sometimes food came out, other times it didn't. 

It was uncertain on which press will the food come out. This time the pigeon pressed the button over and over and over. The food accumulating and going uneaten. The uncertainty whether the button press will give food was hacking the reward circuit of the brain & was giving them dopamine just from pressing the button. 

# Schedules of Reinforcement
Behavior is affected not just _if_ a reward is given, but _when and how often_. E.g., variable ratio schedules (like in slot machines) make behaviors **very persistent**.

When the animal knows (for sure) that food is coming, there's a dopamine spike (up, then down). However, if the animal has to do something to get the food, like press a button, then the dopamine stays high while the animal anticipates the outcome. 

In the case of the phone, when you start doom-scrolling, you are not actually getting dopamine from the content, but rather from the act of scrolling, and the anticipation of something good. 

When playing a video game, you are not enjoying every second of it, but anticipating the rewards. 

## Symbiotic effect
Keeping in mind [[Reinforcers of activity|secondary reinforcers]], both the brain short circuiting hack (skinner box), and the want for more shiny things are powerful in making us do something. If what you're anticipating has no satiation point, you can get stuck in a loop of seeking it indefinitely. 

This knowledge has been leveraged by casinos, slot machines, video games. If you never got the good thing, you would stop coming. That's why they've introduced carefully attuned reward schedules. 

On social media, a mix of good and meh content would mean you keep scrolling.
