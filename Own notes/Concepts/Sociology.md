One of the key terms in anthropology that I need to clarify.

Sociology is the scientific study of human society that focuses on society, human social behavior, patterns of social relationships, social interaction, and aspects of culture associated with everyday life.

Sociological subject matter ranges from micro-level analyses of individual interaction and [[Agency]] to macro-level analyses of social systems and social structure.
