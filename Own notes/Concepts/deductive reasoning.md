Deductive reasoningÂ is a process of using a group of true premises to draw a conclusion that is also true. You start from a broad perspective and narrow it down to the specific case. If the broader generalization is true, then the specific conclusion must also be right.

Deductive reasoning has stricter rules. Every premise has to be true. If there are exceptions to the premise, you can't come to a true conclusion. The conclusion could be valid, but it won't be true. In philosophy, validity and truth are not the same thing.

# Top-down vs Bottom-up logic
When discussing logic, two terms are commonly thrown in. Top-down (deductive), and bottom-up ([[inductive reasoning|inductive]]). 

In top-down, you start with generalization and narrow down to a specific case (deductive). In bottom-up, you start with specific examples and broaden it up to form a generalization (inductive).

# Onset of deductive reasoning
Deductive reasoning comes to children at ages 11-12. It's a form of top-down logic to [[inductive reasoning|inductive's]] bottom up logic.
