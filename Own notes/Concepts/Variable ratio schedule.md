One of the settings in the [[Skinner box]] was the variable ratio schedule. 

It was uncertain on which press will the food come out. This time the pigeon pressed the button over and over and over. The food accumulating and going uneaten. The uncertainty whether the button press will give food was hacking the reward circuit of the brain & was giving them dopamine just from pressing the button. 

 This allows [[Schedule of Reinforcement]] to be used to manipulate human behaviour.
