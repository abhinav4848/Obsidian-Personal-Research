# Skinner box
research from the 60's by B. F. Skinner. 
aka **operant conditioning chamber** which trained the behavior of [[Pigeons in a box]] to different stimuli.

It’s a controlled environment used to study behavior reinforcement (learning through consequences) — specifically, how rewards and punishments shape behavior. 

> [!NOTE] Skinner box + [[Dark Pattern]]
> Any design pattern that hacks the reward pathwyas of your brain to get you to do something you wouldn't, without that design.
