**Idea Emergence** is the process of how the ideas you encounter go from the "nothingness" to the "somethingness"—and how those ideas grow in richness, complexity, and personally meaningful value over time.

- Idea Emergence is how value forms from mixing a person's (or persons') experiences with their uniqueness. 
- Idea Emergence is where past things combine with new situations and something distinct emerges.

In "Personal Knowledge Management, there are 5 Emergence Levels.
## EMERGENCE LEVEL 1
Fleeting thoughts that are nothing on their own become a concrete note that are something.
Here, we are collecting ideas from the primordial idea soup (sources, ideas, interactions, insights) & each new idea solidifies into a unique note.

**DIVERGENCE**  
From the collection and extraction phase, new ideas solidify into unique shapes.
## EMERGENCE LEVEL 2
Notes start to direct link to other notes. Relationships are formed. This is basic Zettelkasten.
In every note, ask yourself, what does this note remind me of? and form a link to that note. 

Direct links only. No higher-order notes have yet been created.  

Using direct links, ideas emerge organically. The limitation is that you're always in the forest. (“I have all these notes… but what do they _mean_?”)
Very often, you want a birds-eye view of these relationships. 
That's where EMERGENCE LEVEL 3 begins

## EMERGENCE LEVEL 3
To get a bird's eye view, we need to make higher-order notes—which are just "notes with primarily links to other notes". Higher-order notes like MOCs (Maps of Content) serve countless purposes.

You can use MOCs to overcome "Mental Squeeze Points" & continue triumphantly w/ your ideas & projects. Just "Assemble" links to notes in a new MOC. Now you've offloaded the cognitive burden so you stay in creative Flow.

MOCs cam serve as RAPID IDEATION CHAMBERS. 
MOCs are IDEATION ACCELERATORS!

Higher-order notes like MOCs can therefore be used for navigational purposes (hence the "Map" nomenclature).
## EMERGENCE LEVEL 4
Linking Higher-order notes.  

With your MOCs, you are 80% of the way done to finalized creation!
At this next level of emergence: MOCs are linked to MOCs! 

This allows you to fly around your note library rapidly, organically getting UNFORCED BEHAVIOR-BASED SPACED REPETITION. Now you have multiple MOCs that easily communicate and contribute to more fun-to-finalize creations!

*EMERGENCE*
Higher order notes are connecting to each other.  

## EMERGENCE LEVEL 5
Make a single HOME NOTE. This consolidates new higher-order notes w/ older, more mature higher-order notes. The Home note is the beginning & the end. It is a launchpad & a homebase.

At this level, your ideas have become like a relatively stable
1. The Home note allows for top-down "Convergent" thinking like navigating and deliberate creating.
2. The Home note allows for bottom-up "Convergent" thinking by consolidating new forms of emergence.
