# Schedules of Reinforcement
Behavior is affected not just _if_ a reward is given, but _when and how often_. E.g., variable ratio schedules (like in slot machines) make behaviors **very persistent**.

When the animal knows (for sure) that food is coming, there's a dopamine spike (up, then down). However, if the animal has to do something to get the food, like press a button, then the dopamine stays high while the animal anticipates the outcome. 

In the case of the phone, when you start doom-scrolling, you are not actually getting dopamine from the content, but rather from the act of scrolling, and the anticipation of something good. 

When playing a video game, you are not enjoying every second of it, but anticipating the rewards.
