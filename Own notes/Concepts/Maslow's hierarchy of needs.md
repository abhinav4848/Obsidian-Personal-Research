It's a concept that shows what needs motivate human behavior. They start from [[primary motivational factors]] to [[secondary motivational factors]].

These needs are related to each other in a hierarchy of prepotency (or strength). i.e. The lower the need on the hierarchy, the more the strength of driving force.
