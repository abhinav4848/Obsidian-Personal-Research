## Definition: 
1. Originated in 15th century, from Late Latin 'lectura' – to read.
2. A discourse given before an audience or class, especially for instruction.

Well-designed programs, modules or learning encounters facilitate learners in developing their knowledge, understanding and skills through 'scaffolding' of learning events. The concept of scaffolding is derived from the work of the Russian psychologist [[Lev Vygotsky]] as well as others (such as Bruner) who researched into early language development.

This is best achieved through structuring learning so that learners engage meaningfully with appropriate topics and tasks, taking on more responsibility for their own learning as they become more competent.

## Scaffolding learning:
Scaffolding means structuring and sequencing the learning in such a way that learning is cumulative, with one step being built upon the next.

Practical skills are taught to learners through 
1. Demonstration, 
2. Deliberate practice, and 
3. Feedback 
so that the learners can become increasingly proficient.

The learner is placed into different situations (zones of proximal development) throughout their learning and thus moves from novice to expert.

## Ways of scaffolding learning
There are two ways scaffolding can be used in lectures which are primarily concerned with **developing knowledge** and **understanding**.

First, the individual lecture itself must be located within the program to support the learner at their stage of professional development. It needs to be clearly linked to other parts of the course and to pre- and post-reading or activities. 
	For example, some early lecture-based learning might include the normal physiology of the heart, followed by abnormal physiology illustrated by common cardiac conditions related to these abnormalities.

This is where e-learning can be very useful as part of the 'scaffold' to help signpost the learners to linked topics, further reading, self-assessments or other extended learning opportunities. One of the ways this is increasingly being achieved is through the **flipped classroom**.

Secondly, when we consider the structure of the lecture itself, it must be designed to be challenging enough to encourage and facilitate deeper learning and engagement with the subject matter.

## Flipped Classroom
The 'flipped classroom' or 'flipped learning' has become mainstream in school-based and higher education, due primarily to the ease which learners are able to access materials through electronic and mobile devices.

The model reverses the typical lecture and homework or follow-up reading elements of a course, so that short video-lectures, narrated presentations or podcasts are viewed by the learner at home before the classroom-based activities.
