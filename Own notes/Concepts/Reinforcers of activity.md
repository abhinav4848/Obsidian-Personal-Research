# Reinforcers of activity
## Primary conditioner rewards
The primary reinforcing stimuli for an action are biological needs like food, water, sex, etc. These have a diminishing effect once an organism is sated or reached the limit of their needs. 

They are called primary because they are not learned. 

This is used in [[Skinner box]].

## Secondary reinforcers
These are drives outside of biological needs, like accumulating wealth and social standing. These have no limit. You are never wealthy enough or famous enough. 

The reason why they are even reinforcers in any way is because they are associated with a primary reinforcer. They do not directly satisfy an innate need but may be the means.Â  

So a secondary reinforcer can be just as powerful a motivator as a primary reinforcer.

This is used in the [[Premack Principle]].
