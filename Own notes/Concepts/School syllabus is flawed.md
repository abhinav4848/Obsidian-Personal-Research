> Knowing how to live with insecurity is the only security. 

We donâ€™t use much of what we learn at school in our daily lives. The real-world, practical skills we acquire after school are mostly through imitation, self-learning and experimentation.

Traditional, hard skills, taught after school, like engineering, accounting, programming etc., are valued and are easy to measure. However, these skills are not permanent, and may only be valuable in the job market for a short while.
