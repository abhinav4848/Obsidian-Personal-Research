*as opposed to [[secondary motivational factors]].*

Also called basic needs/physiological needs. 
They are called primary because they are not learned. 
They are at the bottom of [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs]], and are the strongest needs.

The primary reasons for doing an action are biological needs like food, water, sex, etc. These have a diminishing effect once an organism is sated or reached the limit of their needs.
