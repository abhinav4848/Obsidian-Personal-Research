- Focus on the [[Levels of analysis in psychology|levels of the brain and the person]]. 
- Led by Max Wertheimer – noted that much of the content of our thoughts comes from what we perceive, and further, from inborn tendencies to structure what we sense in certain ways. 
- Developed >100 perceptual laws (principles) that describe how our minds organize the world
	- *Perceptual unit* – a whole formed from individual parts

>If our perceptions are not accurate, our corresponding thoughts and feelings will be based on distorted views of reality.
- The research of the Gestaltists addressed how mental processes work, and this work in turn led to detailed studies of how the brain gives rise to such mental processes and how mental processes influence mental contents.
