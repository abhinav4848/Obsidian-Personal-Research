# First Principles thinking
> [!info]
> It is a framework for thinking. Boil things down to their fundamental truths and reason them out from there. Rather than reasoning by analogy. - Elon Musk

First principles thinking is a problem-solving method that involves breaking down complex problems into their most basic elements and then reevaluating everything from scratch. Instead of relying on analogies or past experiences, first principles thinking starts with fundamental truths or facts that are incontrovertible. By reasoning from these foundational principles, one can derive innovative solutions or understandings.

This approach was famously advocated by [[Aristotle]] and later popularized by Elon Musk, who often uses it to revolutionize industries. For example, when designing SpaceX rockets, Musk didn't start with existing rocket designs but rather with the basic physics principles governing rocket propulsion, materials, and costs, leading to significant innovations in rocket technology.

In essence, first principles thinking encourages a fresh perspective and enables breakthroughs by questioning assumptions and building solutions from the ground up.
