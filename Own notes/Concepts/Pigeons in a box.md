# Pigeons in a box experiment
Skinner put pigeons/rats in a [[Skinner box|box]] with a lever & food supply ([[Reinforcers of activity]]).
There were three things that could happen
### 1. When button was pressed, pigeon got food
So they pressed when they needed food, got a dopamine spike and that was it.
### 2. Nothing happened when button was pressed 
so clearly pigeons did not press the button. 
### 3. [[Variable ratio schedule]]
Sometimes food came out, other times it didn't. 

This [[Schedule of Reinforcement]] can make behaviors very persistent.
[[Symbiotic effect of secondary reinforcers and variable ratio schedules|Together with secondary reinforcers]], variable ratio schedule is used to manipulate human activity in many ways. 


# Superstition
Instead of giving a reward for a specific action and training a specific behavior, Skinner would take a hungry pigeon and place it in a box that would release a food pellet at random. The pigeons developed all kinds of complex behavioral responses such as bowing, scraping, dancing, and neck turns.

What happened was the pigeon would receive the food pellet while it happened to be performing some action, and rather than attributing the food pellet reward to randomness, it would assume that the appearance of the food pellet had something to do with its behavior. So it started doing whatever that action was, over and over again, and sure enough, it was eventually rewarded with a food pellet again. Since the pigeon is increasing the amount of time spent performing a particular action, it is also increasing the number of times it is "rewarded" for that action, even though the reward is random.

## Shaping
Skinner also developed a technique called shaping through successive approximation. By rewarding more and more exaggerated behavior, complex actions could be trained through small successive rewards. For example, if a pigeon turned its head left, some food is dropped. The next time the pigeon does that he has to turn a little more left to get the food. Eventually you can train the pigeon to turn all the way around in a circle.
