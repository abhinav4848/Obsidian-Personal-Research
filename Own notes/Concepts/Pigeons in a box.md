# Pigeons in a box experiment
Skinner put pigeons/rats in a [[Skinner box|box]] with a lever & food supply ([[Reinforcers of activity]]).
There were three things that could happen
### 1. When button was pressed, pigeon got food
So they pressed when they needed food, got a dopamine spike and that was it.
### 2. Nothing happened when button was pressed 
so clearly pigeons did not press the button. 
### 3. [[Variable ratio schedule]]
Sometimes food came out, other times it didn't. 

This [[Schedule of Reinforcement]] can make behaviors very persistent.
[[Symbiotic effect of secondary reinforcers and variable ratio schedules|Together with secondary reinforcers]], variable ratio schedule is used to manipulate human activity in many ways.
