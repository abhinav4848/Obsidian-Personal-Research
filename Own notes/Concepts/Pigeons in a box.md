# Pigeons in a box experiment
There were three things that could happen
### 1. When button was pressed, pigeon got food
So they pressed when they needed food, got a dopamine spike and that was it.
### 2. Nothing happened when button was pressed 
so clearly pigeons did not press the button. 
### 3. [[Variable ratio schedule]]
Sometimes food came out, other times it didn't. 
This [[Schedule of Reinforcement]] can make behaviors very persistent and [[Symbiotic effect of secondary reinforcers and variable ratio schedules|together with secondary reinforcers]] are used to manipulate human activity in many ways.
