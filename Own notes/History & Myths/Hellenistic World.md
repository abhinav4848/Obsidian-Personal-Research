Period lasting. 323 – 30 BC
Part of Greek History

Polybius (200-118BC) was a Greek Historian who first was imprisoned by Romans and later worked with influential Romans. He documented the rise of Rome in just 56 years in a 40 volume book.
He was born in the Greek city of Megalopolis.

Alexander the Great (323 BC) of [Macedonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macedonia_(ancient_kingdom)), Greece, spread Greek culture from Egypt to Mesopotamia, at least among the ruling class. Much came out of this period. Architectural perfection of [Parthenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthenon), Sculpture of [Doryphoros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doryphoros), Plays of [Sophocles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophocles), Philosophy of [[Plato]]. 

Romans took over from the West and within 1 generation, overthrew all kingdoms of Hellenistic world. Polybius documents his history of Rome from 264BC. That was the year Romans initiated attacks outside of Italy. 

## Rome Geography
Rome sits beside River Tiber. 
Alps are to the north of Italy, [Apennine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apennine_Mountains) mountains run through length of Italy. 
2 most important Hills: 
- Capitoline- Had steed slopes. Has Tarpeian rock from where criminals were overthrown. They build temple of Jupiter Capitolinus, after the king of the gods. 
- Palatine Hill- House of Romulus, the founder of Rome was preserved on this hill while everything else developed. It was the most desirable address in the city.

## Aeneas
He's a minor character in Iliad, by Homer. According to Greek history, he was the son of a Trojan prince and the goddess Aphrodite. When Troy was destroyed by the Greeks, he somehow fled the city and disappeared into the wilderness. 
Roman poet Virgil, in his book Aeneid, he eventually washed ashore in Italy, married a Latin girl, and with his companions, founded the city of Lavinium, named after his last wife. Aeneas' descendants founded the city of Rome. He is thus credited as being the forefather of Roman people. 

### [Iulus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascanius) (Ascanius)
Son of Aeneas, is said to be the progenitor of one the most important families in Roman history, the Julii- had members such as Julius Caesar, Augustus. By claiming that they were of divine lineage, they lay claim to being of divine lineage. 

### Romulus and Remus
One of the descendants of Iulus, became king by murdering the other and his family. He then forced his brother's daughter to be a virgin so that she would not have any children who might seek revenge against him. But she became pregnant and said it was due to rape by God of Mars, god of war. She gave birth to Romulus and Remus. Because of their possibly divine lineage, the king was afraid of killing them directly so had them [[tied to a basket]] and thrown into Tiber river to drown. But the Tiber was flooded at the time so they washed ashore at slopes of Capitoline hill where a wolf looked after them along with a woodpecker. (famous statue)
Both the wolf and woodpecker are associated with God of Mars. 
Ultimately the boys were discovered by a shepherd who raised them as his own. Eventually he revealed to them the truth of their being and so they overthrew the king. 

They decided to establish a city at the place where the wolf had rescued them. They couldn't decide who would be king so Romulus killed Remus. 
# Three chronologies in Rome
Monarchy (753-509 BC)- Starts with Romulus
Republic (509-31 BC)- The mixed constitution admired by Polybius. 
Empire (31BC-476 AD)- Reverted to one man rule under the emperors. This era began with victory of Augustus, the first emperor over his rival, Mark Antony. The end is not certain. 

# Monarchy
## Roman customs
1. **Pomerium** – The _pomerium_ was the sacred boundary of Rome, marked by Romulus when he founded the city. It was a religious border, beyond which no weapons could be carried, and no buildings constructed. It symbolized the separation between the city of the living (civitas) and the realm of the dead.
2. **Rape of the Sabine Women** – After founding Rome, Romulus and his mostly male followers needed wives. They invited the neighboring Sabines to a festival and, during the event, seized and married the Sabine women. This led to a war, but the women eventually intervened, stopping the fighting and leading to a peaceful merger between the Romans and Sabines.
3. **Talassius and Talasse Custom** – According to legend, during the Rape of the Sabine Women, one particularly beautiful woman was claimed for a nobleman under the pretense that she was for "Talassius." This name became associated with marriage, and Roman wedding processions would traditionally shout "Talassio!" as a good omen.
4. **Custom of Groom Carrying the Bride Over the Threshold** – This Roman wedding tradition is said to originate from the Rape of the Sabine Women. Since the Sabine women were taken against their will, carrying the bride over the threshold symbolized her reluctant departure from her old home, reflecting ancient marriage customs where marriages were often arranged or forceful.
5. **Tarpeia and Tarpeian Rock** – Tarpeia was a Roman maiden who betrayed Rome to the Sabines in exchange for what she thought would be gold. Instead, the Sabines crushed her to death under their shields. Her name was given to the _Tarpeian Rock_, a cliff from which traitors were thrown as punishment.
6. **Merger of Rome with Sabines & Second King of Rome** – After the Sabine women stopped the war, the Romans and Sabines united, co-ruling Rome. Romulus shared power with the Sabine king, _Titus Tatius_. After Tatius' death, Romulus ruled alone. The second king of Rome was _Numa Pompilius_ (753-673 BC), a Sabine known for his wisdom and religious reforms, credited with establishing many Roman religious institutions.
## Numa Pompilius
He set up many religious institutions of Rome. He created the office of chief priest, known as Pontifex Maximus which was later adopted by the catholic church as the official title of the Pope. He built a temple of Janus, and said when Rome was at war, door should be open else closed. 
He also fixed the Roman calendar. 
### Cloaca maxima
Built by him. Was used to drain sewer waste into Tiber river. Can still be seen today. 
## Heroes of this era
Mucius, Horatius, Cincinnatus
## End of this era
At the end of this era, the last 2 kings were supposed to be from The Ertuscans region. The last one was Lucius Tarquinius Superbus (Tarquin the Proud). He ruled from around **535–509 BCE** and was known for his tyranny and oppressive rule. This led to some bitterness among Romans that a great kingdom like theirs was being ruled by an outsider. 
# Republic
Up until 500BC, the city of Rome was just one among the many cities in Italy. At this point, they converted their government to the republic style. 
There were other cities like (From North to South): Gauls, Ertuscans, Umbrians, Sabines, Rome, Latins, Samnites, Greeks.
## Lucretia
[Lucretia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucretia) was the heroine of this era. 

The last king of Rome was **Lucius Tarquinius Superbus** . His downfall came after the **rape of Lucretia**, a noblewoman who was assaulted by his son, Sextus Tarquinius. This led to an uprising led by **Lucius Junius Brutus**, which resulted in the expulsion of Tarquin and the abolition of the monarchy. Rome then transitioned into a **Republic**, governed by elected magistrates and a Senate.

## Roman Senate
An advisory council of the Republic. They wore Togas with purple stripe. Membership was for life. Almost everything it recommended came to pass.
