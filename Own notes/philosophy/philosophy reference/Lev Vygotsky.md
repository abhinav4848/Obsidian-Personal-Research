1896 â€“ 1934 (age 37, USSR)
 Best known for his work on *psychological development in children* and creating the framework known as *cultural-historical activity theory*.
 
Vygotsky suggested that individuals learn through the 'teacher' constructing events with sufficient challenge so that learners are in the 'Zone of Proximal Development'.

This is best achieved through structuring learning so that learners engage meaningfully with appropriate topics and tasks, taking on more responsibility for their own learning as they become more competent.
