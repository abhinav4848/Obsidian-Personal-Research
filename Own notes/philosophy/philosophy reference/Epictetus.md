Epictetus (c. 50 â€“ c. 135 AD) was a Greek Stoic philosopher. He was born into slavery at Hierapolis, Phrygia (present-day Pamukkale, in western Turkey). He was emancipated from slavery, and lived in Rome until his banishment (Emperor Domitian banished all philosophers from Rome), when he went to Nicopolis in northwestern Greece, where he spent the rest of his life.
