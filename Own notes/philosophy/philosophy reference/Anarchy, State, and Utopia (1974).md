Robert Nozick asked us to imagine that scientists have developed the ultimate innovation in virtual reality, known as the Experience Machine. (We may not be too far away from this invention!) The Machine allows you to have any experience you like, for as long as you like – for an hour, a day, two years, even for the rest of your life, perhaps. Your body will rest comfortably, tended by nurses, and nourished through feeding tubes. Meanwhile, your mind will experience the best your imagination has to offer. You can achieve the fame and fortune you’ve always wanted, cure cancer, or heroically climb mountains – whatever you choose. However, Nozick sets the situation up so that you’ll forget you’re wired to the Machine, and the simulation is so complete that while you’re in it you’ll be convinced that these experiences are really happening. It will all feel as real as the experiences you’re having right now, and there will be no way to tell you’re in a simulation.

Next Nozick gives you a choice of either an entire life inside the Machine or life outside it. He set the thought experiment up this way to ask whether pleasure really is the only thing we desire, since while in the Machine a person can have as much pleasure as they can imagine. But Nozick himself had no interest in entering the Machine for life, and he thought most of us wouldn’t either, just because the experiences it gives us don’t correspond with reality. So even though you might feel like you’re having meaningful relationships inside the Machine, in the actual world, you’re lying on a bed having simulated experiences of being with non-existent people. Nozick concluded that truth is also a value to us that is not superseded by pleasure.
