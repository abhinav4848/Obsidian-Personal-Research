 Is it a question about a moral life, a life of pleasure, a question of meaning, or is it about self-development and self-actualisation?

## [[Socrates]]
A good life is an examined life. It involves constant philosophical inquiry and self-knowledge. Reflection and questioning are essential to living well.

“the unexamined life is not worth living.” For him, our life’s work (his idea of a good life) is to question one’s thinking rationally, and so to ‘know thyself’ through a relentless spirit of philosophical enquiry and dialogue with others.
  
## [[Albert Camus]]
Life has no inherent meaning ([[absurdism]]), and we are like [[Sisyphus]] rolling a boulder endlessly.
However, we can create meaning by choosing to value our actions, even if they seem futile.

Camus thought that each of us is like Sisyphus, in that nothing that any of us does is inherently important, because life just doesn’t have any inherent meaning. We’re all just rolling boulders up our particular hills. We can, however, choose to _give_ meaning to what we do. After all, for the existentialists, we decide what to value, so when we throw ourselves into a task, it becomes filled with meaning – a meaning we give it.

On the one hand, it’s saying that nothing you do matters, but on the other hand, it’s saying that anything that you do matters, provided you choose to imbue it with value: 
- become a doctor and save lives; 
- be a stay-at-home parent and look after children; 
- create beautiful art works; 
- find a career that gives you the space in your life to pursue a hobby you like; 
- volunteer your time to promote a cause you care about; 
- or just learn card tricks. 
In a sense it doesn’t matter what you do, what matters is that it’s meaningful for you. Basically, existentialists tell us that our lives and our meanings are in our own hands. So, if you’re unhappy, you should change your life.

## [[Robert Nozick]]
Through the thought experiment of the '[[Anarchy, State, and Utopia (1974)|Experience Machine]]', Nozick challenges the idea that pleasure is the only value in life. He argues that people value truth and real experiences more than simulated pleasures, suggesting a preference for real-world impact.

If having an actual impact on the real world is important to you, that’s one thing the Experience Machine wouldn’t be able to give you. However, if you’re a [[hedonist]] – a person who believes ‘the good’ is equal to ‘the pleasurable’ – then simply having whatever pleasurable experiences you desire is what you most want. In that case, it might then be hard to see why you shouldn’t enter the Experience Machine. After all, it would let you experience things you could never have experienced otherwise.

## [[Aristotle]]
A good life is one of flourishing and self-improvement. Humans must strive to become more virtuous, rational, and wise. There is a human essence, and living in accordance with reason is essential for flourishing. He rejects the idea that all choices are equally valid for living well.

Aristotle believed in a human essence, which implies that there’s a proper way to be a human being, and live a human life, and that we’ll only flourish by finding that path. Aristotle defined humans as ‘rational animals’, so living a good human life means seeking to know your world, know yourself, and strive to govern yourself through reason. Generally, you should work to be the best, most virtuous version of yourself. But is this goal realistic? And can people who are suffering poverty, war, or torture then ever be said to have good lives?

## [[Simon Blackburn]]
Philosophy helps us step back and question our perspectives, allowing us to see things more clearly, understand differing viewpoints, and avoid being dogmatic.

## [[Bertrand Russell]]
Philosophy does not provide definite answers but is valuable because it broadens our perspectives, enriches imagination, and encourages open-mindedness, which may itself be part of living a good life.
