Change curve moves through the original [[five stages of grief]]. The emotions also tell us what people in these stages of transition need to support them.

### Stage 1: Shock
When the change initially happens, people firstly go into shock. This is the initial stunned, numb feeling you get when being told the news.
### Stage Two: Denial 
People refuse to accept the news. This can be characterized by people burying their head in the sand, pretending that the change hasn’t happened or just generally disengaging with change altogether. At this point the curve lifts, as this stage raises our morale as we tell ourselves that nothing has changed.

Denial is often thought of as a defense mechanism, or a way to “dose” the overwhelming feelings of loss. We may use the analogy of a coffee drinker. A coffee drinker can handle a few sips of caffeinated coffee at a time, but the idea of chugging a whole pot at once can be unpleasant and unhealthy. In the same way, denial allows us to “sip on” the feelings of grief without letting it overwhelm us completely.

Denial becomes unhealthy only when it prevents someone from moving through the other stages of grief. At some point, a person will have to face the reality of their loss and process their emotions accordingly. It’s certainly painful, but it’s the only way to move through grief and come out a stronger and more accepting person.

### Stage Three: Anger
The curve then sinks low again as people start to experience anger. This can manifest itself in different ways, sometimes with people expressing anger at a range of things around the change. This could include people starting arguments with others, breaking rules and even ‘lashing out’. This is a very visible stage and you may have seen people expressing their anger as part of their reaction to the pandemic and its implications.

### Stage Four: Bargaining
The fourth stage is where we start to engage with the process, but not in a constructive way. Here, people start to have trade-offs. There’s still an element of denial here as this bargaining can sometimes be unrealistic, and often about trying to minimize the impact of the change on themselves. People might just hold onto their old way with some tweaks around the edges to make it seem like they’re adapting, without making any real changes to the way they work, for example.

### Stage Five: Depression and Confusion
This is the lowest point of the change curve, where people feel the darkest of emotions. They can become withdrawn at this point and not want to engage at all. It’s common for people to retreat into themselves and start withdrawing from social contact. There is a tendency for people to become fixated on small issues at this stage.

### Stage Six: Acceptance 
During stage six, the curve rises vertically into acceptance. This stage is where people start to properly understand and accept the change. As a result, morale and performance begins to improve at this point. Once people reach the acceptance stage, they may start to engage more in the process. This may include asking questions or starting to make some small but genuine changes in their behavior.

### Stage Seven: Problem Solving 
The final stage is where we move into a more constructive and positive mindset. Here, people start to meaningfully engage with the change. They may start to ask themselves what opportunities there are and how they can make the best of the situation. In a grief situation, this is often described as finding meaning. The final stage is a change in mindset to trying to adjust to the new way and look for the positives in it.
