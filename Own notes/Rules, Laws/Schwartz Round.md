Structured forum designed to help healthcare professionals process the emotional and relational aspects of their work.

**What:**
Hospital-wide, multidisciplinary forums where staff share and reflect on the emotional impact of their work.

**Who:**  
Open to all staff- doctors, nurses, porters, clerical, etc. A panel of 2 - 3 people share stories based on a theme (e.g., “A patient I’ll never forget”), followed by group reflection. 

**Focus:** 
- Emotional and human side of healthcare.
- Shared understanding, empathy, and connection across roles.

**Structure:**
1. Intro & theme introduction
2. Panel shares stories
3. Open reflection/discussion (not problem-solving)

**Why it's helpful:**
- Promotes compassion and connection across the team.
- Encourages staff wellbeing and reduces emotional isolation.
