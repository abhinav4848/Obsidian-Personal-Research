 It's a structured forum designed to help healthcare professionals process the emotional and relational aspects of their work.
 
**What:**  
Small, regular discussion groups (typically 6–12 participants) where clinicians explore the doctor–patient relationship.

**Who:**  
Usually GPs, trainees, and other frontline clinicians. Led by a trained Balint facilitator.

**Focus:**
- Emotional and relational dynamics in clinical encounters.
- What a difficult patient interaction meant for the doctor.
- Emphasizes _feelings_, not problem-solving or medical diagnosis.

**Example:**  
You present a case of a patient you found frustrating or emotionally draining. The group discusses _why_ it felt that way, what unspoken dynamics may be at play, and how it affected you.

**Why it's useful for GPs:**
- Improves empathy and insight into patient behavior.
- Builds resilience and reduces burnout.
- Develops reflective practice, which is essential for GP training.
