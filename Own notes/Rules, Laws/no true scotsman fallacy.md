The **No True Scotsman fallacy** is a logical fallacy that occurs when someone attempts to protect a generalization from counterexamples by changing the definition of the group to exclude the counterexample. Essentially, it’s a way to dismiss evidence that contradicts a claim by saying that the counterexample doesn’t really belong to the group being discussed.

### How It Works:

1. **Initial Claim:** A generalization is made about a group.
   - Example: "No Scotsman puts sugar in his porridge."

2. **Counterexample:** Someone presents an example that contradicts this generalization.
   - Example: "But Angus is a Scotsman, and he puts sugar in his porridge."

3. **Revised Claim:** Instead of accepting that the generalization might be wrong, the person making the claim redefines the group to exclude the counterexample.
   - Example: "Well, no *true* Scotsman would put sugar in his porridge."

In this example, the definition of "Scotsman" is arbitrarily changed to exclude anyone who puts sugar in their porridge, thus protecting the original claim from being proven false.

### Why It’s a Fallacy:
The fallacy lies in the fact that the person making the claim refuses to acknowledge evidence that contradicts their generalization by shifting the goalposts, making the claim unfalsifiable. This tactic undermines logical discussion and reasoning by avoiding genuine engagement with the counterargument.
