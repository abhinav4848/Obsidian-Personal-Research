It is a mental shortcut or rule-of-thumb that simplifies decision making. It helps find solutions with limited effort and is an approximate method that works well enough in most situations, even though it doesn't guarantee the optimal or correct answer. 

# Difference with Algorithm

| Feature     | **Heuristic**                             | **Algorithm**                                     |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Goal        | Find a good enough solution fast          | Find the exact solution (or prove none exists)    |
| Guarantees  | No guarantee of optimality or correctness | Guarantees correct result (if the algorithm ends) |
| Cost        | Low computational / mental cost           | Often higher time/space cost                      |
| Flexibility | Adaptable, can be tweaked on the fly      | Fixed step‑by‑step procedure                      |
# Why use a heuristic
Time pressure- You need an answer now. (which route to take to work)
Limited information- You don't have all the data (estimating the cost of a car)
Cognitive load- Your brain can't evaluate every possibility (e.g. remembering 30 passwords)

# Some known heuristics
Availability heuristic- Judge the frequency or likelihood by how easily examples come to mind. e.g. After hearing news about a plane crash, you overestimate the danger of flying. 

Representativeness heuristic- Assess probability by similarity to a prototype. Assume someone with glasses is more likely to be a librarian than a farmer. 

Anchoring and adjustment- Rely heavily on an initial value (anchor) and make insufficient adjustments. e.g. Starting salary negotiations from the first number you hear, even if it's arbitrary. 

Recognition heuristic- Prefer the option you recognise. e.g. Choosing a brand you've heard of over an unknown one when buying electronics.
