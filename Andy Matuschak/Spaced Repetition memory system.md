### The Forgetting curve

Over time we forget data at an exponential rate. 

Important thing about forgetting curve and how we can take advantage of it is that every time we interrupt the forgetting curve, the decay rate slows: It takes longer for us to forget something.

### What is spaced repetition

**Spaced Repetition:** When you spread your revision over a period of time, and we review topics ideally by active recalls at particular intervals. 

This is in contrast to cramming which only lasts for maybe one or two days afterwards. 

The harder your brain has to work to retrieve something, the stronger that information gets encoded. The idea of spaced repetition is that you allow your brain to forget some of the information. Such that when you revise it again, it‚Äôs not mindless repetition. It‚Äôs actually taking you some brain power. And the more brain power it takes, i.e. the more you‚Äôve forgotten, the harder your brain has to work ‚Üí the more strongly that information is encoded. 

So we have to initially have small intervals between repetition and then gradually increase the interval duration. Most importantly, this repetition should be by active recall rather than just re-reading. 

## Study Spaced Retrieval: Absolute Spacing Enhances Learning Regardless Of Relative Spacing

The study had 4 groups of students study foreign words and then were tested. Group 3 & 4 spent the same time studying

1. This group saw the words once
2. Saw and then recalled once
3. Saw, recalled once, recalled again immediately afterwards
4. Saw, recalled once, had a gap of few words, then recalled again
- This was the result

### Tips for applying spaced repetition in your own studies

People tend to just read/highlight instead of active recall cuz it‚Äôs less cognitively demanding.

Don‚Äôt do things anecdotally. i.e. n=1 experience (meaning personal experience is not a scientific study)

1. Anki
2. Practicing something for 10 mins a day is better than practicing something for an hour once a week. **The way our brain develops is during sleep. So the more sleep intervals between revisions, the better the connection.** So the amount of benefit you get per unit of time is greater. Do a little bit each day and be consistent.
- Scoping a subject
    
    Your first job is to know your subject chapters or topics inside out. Have a broad conceptual outline before you start with any revision. 
    
    One good way to do this is to look at past papers and categorize the topics being tested. 
    
- Ali‚Äôs spaced repetition spreadsheet
    
    [How to Study for Exams - Spaced Repetition | Evidence-based revision tips](https://youtu.be/Z-zNHHpXoMM?t=841)
    
    ![Untitled](Spaced%20Repetition-%20Revision%20excel%20sheet%20used%20by%20Ali%20Abdaal.png)
    
    Write all topics in column A.
    
    Every time you study a topic by active recall, you‚Äôre allowed to write the date in column B. 
    
    Then if you do again, write the new date in column C. And so on. 
    
    Now for each revision, see how well you were able to recall the subject. Start with red, orange, yellow, Green. 
    
    On a new day, start with revising all the red topics, then move up the colors. 
    
    You‚Äôll notice that with successive revisions, your reds will start to turn green. 
    
- How to apply this technique best
    
    Start with the topics you don‚Äôt know. So you can start from the end of the book rather than the beginning cuz the starting bits, students tend to be more familiar with.
    
    Do interleave practice. 
    
- **Interleave practice**
    
    Each day try to fill as many boxes as you can on the spreadsheet. The reasoning is that it‚Äôs far better to blitz through a topic and try to actively recall, than it is to spend 10 hours on a single topic. We have a bias that we want to focus on getting better at one topic before we move on. But instead, with this spreadsheet, the idea is that with blitzing, we‚Äôre not expecting to get better at this topic today but we know that we‚Äôll be repeating this topic 7-8 times before the exams. 
    
    So interleave practice means that you do something, but before you become a master of it, you move on to something else, then something else. So there‚Äôs studies done in sports athletes, the moment the hockey player was getting good at a move, the coach changed to practicing something else, then something else. This way, it was seen, the skill was improved faster and stayed reliable longer.

# **Spaced repetition memory system**

A spaced-repetition memory system combines the¬†[Testing effect](Testing%20effect.md)¬†and the¬†[**Spacing effect**](Spacing%20effect.md) ¬†to enable efficient memorization of many thousands of facts ([Spaced repetition memory systems are extremely efficient](Spaced%20repetition%20memory%20systems%20are%20extremely%20efficient.md)). Some people also use them for a broader set of tasks (see below).¬†[Spaced repetition memory systems make memory a choice](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zSTqsQ4ATXB61k3Z43TforN), but they‚Äôre not just for rote facts:¬†[Spaced repetition memory systems can be used to develop conceptual understanding](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z9Vi7YVx7NzxU2wawNgsJbk).

The first consumer system of this kind was¬†[Supermemo](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z2oUypiCEtPaDqNjbUsawCj), created by¬†[Piotr Wozniak](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zT8N3LTbePn2LVD7ZhJ5TLr). It adopted and popularized the term ‚Äúspaced repetition‚Äù; prior literature had used a variety of terms (often referring to more specific facets of the underlying phenomenon).
