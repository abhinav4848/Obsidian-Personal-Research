Sertraline for me had impact of the OP image, way too numbed out, never getting upset & just going along with whatever. Foggy 

Going off it gave me anxiety too, but it went away. 

I avoided taking anti depressants because of sentiments like OP image, *I'll lose the real me* even though I was in a terrible place and desperately needed held. 

So I can't stress enough, if y'all are struggling for an extended period, it's worth trying low dose of anti depressants. Try everything before giving up - better, clean diet, (no hyper processed foods, home cooked), therapy to process trauma / struggle, bit of exercise (at home, something easy to stick with, reduce friction & momentum needed to start) get thyroid TSH levels checked, anemia, etc. 

You might just have adhd and get prescribed meds for those if anti depressants don't work.
