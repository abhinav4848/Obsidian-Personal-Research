The “levels” view of psychology lets you see how different types of theories and discoveries illuminate the same phenomenon but also lets you see how these theories and discoveries are interconnected – and thus how the field of psychology as a whole emerges from them.

1. **Level of the brain** – events that involve the activity, structure, properties of the organ itself – brain cells and their connections, the chemical solutions in which they exist, and the genes 

2. **Level of the person** – events that involve the function (mental processes) and content (mental content) of the mind 
	- Mental contents – knowledge, beliefs (including ideas, explanations, and expectations), desires (such as hopes, goals, and needs), and feelings (such as fears, guilts, and attractions)
		- Ex: visualizing the letter “n” in your head
		
	- Mental processes – sets of operations that work together to carry out a function, such as attention, perception, or memory 
		- Ex: rotating the letter “n” in your head

> Note: the brain and the mind are not the same thing! 

3. **Level of the group** – events that involve relationships between people (such as love, competition, and cooperation), relationships among groups, and culture
	- How other people affect an individual’s mind and behavior
	- Distinct identities of groups (ex: culture – language, beliefs, values, norms, behaviors, and even material objects that are passed from one generation to the next) 

It is important to relate each level of analysis to the physical world that surrounds all of us! Events at the [[Pace Layering- How Complex Systems Learn and Keep Learning|different levels]] are also constantly interacting
- Events at each level modify and trigger events at the other levels.
