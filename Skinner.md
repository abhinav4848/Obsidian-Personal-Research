research from the 60's by B. F. Skinner.
Your phone is a skinner box.

Pigeons in a box experiment.
1. When button pressed, pigeon got food. So they pressed when they needed food. 
2. Nothing happened when button pressed so clearly pigeons did not press the button. 
3. Variable schedule- Sometimes food came out, other times it didn't. It was uncertain on which press will the food come out. This time th e pigeon pressed the button over and over and over. The food accumulating and going uneaten. The uncertainty whether the button press will give food was hacking the reward circuit of the brain & was giving them dopamine just from pressing the button.
