The reward systems of the brain are a group of structures that are activated whenever we experience something rewarding, such as eating a nice-tasting food, having sex, or using an [[addiction|addictive]] drug. Structures that are considered to be a part of this reward system are found along the primary [[dopamine]] pathways of the brain. 

> When exposed to a stimulus that is rewarding, the brain responds by releasing an increased amount of Dopamine. 

## Neurobiology of the Reward Pathway: From Perception to Behavioral Reinforcement
### 1. Perception of a Rewarding Stimulus:

Brain encounters a rewarding stimulus, whether it’s an external object or an internal thought -> This perception gets processed by various regions of the brain, including the [[hippocampus]] (which provides context based on past experiences) and the [[amygdala]] (which adds emotional weight to the stimulus).

### 2. Activation of the Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA):

Upon the recognition of the rewarding stimulus, the VTA is stimulated to produce and release dopamine. The exact mechanism can vary: for [[primary motivational factors|natural rewards]], the VTA responds to signals from other parts of the brain. For drugs of abuse, many directly increase dopamine production or release in the VTA. 

### 3. Dopamine Transmission to the [[Nucleus Accumbens]] (NAc):

Once dopamine is released from the VTA, it travels through the mesolimbic pathway to the NAc. In the NAc, dopamine binds to receptors on the surfaces of neurons, changing their activity. *This change in neuronal activity is the underlying neurobiological event that translates to feelings of pleasure and reward.*

### 4. Reinforcement Learning and Behavioral Response:

After the rewarding experience, the prefrontal cortex (which plays a role in decision-making and planning) assesses the entire event. It connects the pleasure from the NAc with the original stimulus and the action taken. The stronger the pleasurable response in the NAc, the stronger the reinforcement signal sent to the prefrontal cortex and other areas responsible for memory and behavior. As a result, the individual becomes more inclined to seek out or engage in that specific behavior or context in anticipation of the reward. Over time, through repeated exposures, this leads to learned behaviors or habits.

### 5. The Role of Feedback:

Continuous feedback loops exist between the NAc, VTA, and prefrontal cortex. These loops help refine and adjust behaviors to optimize reward-seeking actions over time. For instance, if an anticipated reward doesn’t result in the expected pleasure, the feedback loop may reduce the motivation to pursue that specific reward in the future.
1. Since the nucleus accumbens have circuits with the [[amygdala]], a region of the limbic system associated with emotions, this attributes feelings towards the experienced reward. For instance, after eating nice food, the amygdala contributes to our feelings of enjoyment and happiness as a result. 
2. Connections of the nucleus accumbens to the [[hippocampus]], a region involved in memory, would help attribute memory and learning to the reward. So, after eating nice food, our hippocampus would help with remembering where the food was purchased from and will remind us of our enjoyment of this food. Therefore, all these brain areas work together to encourage the repetition of rewarding behaviors.
