# Premack Principle
The [Premack principle](https://www.simplypsychology.org/premack-principle.html) is a form of positive reinforcement in operant conditioning.

It suggests using a preferred activity (high-probability behavior) as a reward for completing a less preferred one (low-probability behavior).

This method incentivizes the less desirable behavior by associating it with a desirable outcome, thus strengthening the less favored behavior.

The Premack Principle is sometimes called Grandma’s Rule – “First eat your vegetables, then you can have dessert” – and is considered one of the more effective and positive approaches to behavior modification.
